# SSB - Super Secure Bank

## Description

Once upon a time, in a land far far away, there was a bank called Super Secure Bank. It was the most secure bank in the world. It was so secure that no one could ever hack it. But then, one day, a hacker came along and hacked it and encrypted all the data. Could you help the bank to recover the data and find the flag?
