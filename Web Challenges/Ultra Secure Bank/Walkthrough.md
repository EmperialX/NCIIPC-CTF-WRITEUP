4. **Forward this Request also.. at this time we will not get the flag. Even if we registered as admin :(**
5.**if we try to change password of the admin with hos 'uid' . it states that we need to be in localhost to change admin's Password [will give you explaination at the End.!]**
6. After spending more than **9 hours** on this challenge i tried this thing & it worked 4 me.
7. Both request which we have forwarded into repeater we need to send them simultaneously & we will get the flag
     <br> <br>   <br> **HERE IS HOW.!**
 * In Repeater 1st send /api/register Request we will get "Registration Successful"
 * Now Send /api/login request within 10 Seconds .. **We Got the Flag**
